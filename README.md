# Analysing Music Market Using SQL 

In this project, I worked with Chinook database in order to answer some business questions in the music market using SQL. Chinook is a sample database and the Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers, like a small iTunes Store.

I analysed the database and answered some business questions to increase profits and reduce losses. Such as:

- Choosing the right artist to invest based on the analysis in the USA market.
- Analysing Employee Sales Performances for a higher productivity
- Analysing Sales by Country to choose in which market they should advertise
- More profitable investment: Albums or Individual Tracks
